# Code Refactoring Changes

This document outlines the changes made to improve code quality in the Appraisers Task Queue module.

## 2025-05-16: Increased Timeouts for Backend API Communication

### Summary

Increased the timeout values for communication with the appraisals-backend service to prevent ECONNRESET errors during long-running operations.

### Changes Made

1. Added AbortController with a 30-minute timeout in the `visualize` method of AppraisalService
2. Increased the PDF generation timeout from 2 minutes to 15 minutes in PDFService
3. Implemented proper timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Benefits

1. Prevents connection timeouts during report generation for complex appraisals
2. Improves reliability of the PDF generation process
3. Maintains system stability during long-running operations
4. Reduces failed appraisals due to timeout issues

## 1. Service File Standardization

All service files have been standardized to follow the `.service.js` naming convention:

- `email.js` → `email.service.js`
- `wordpress.js` → `wordpress.service.js` 
- `openai.js` → `openai.service.js`

For backward compatibility, the original files have been maintained as re-export modules that import from the new standardized files.

## 2. Method Naming Standardization

Methods names have been standardized across services for consistency:

- In `wordpress.service.js`: `getPost()` → `getAppraisalPost()` (with backward compatibility)
- Added `isInitialized()` checks to all services 

## 3. Improved Error Handling

- Added better error handling in service methods
- Enhanced logging with more detailed error information
- Fixed inconsistent try/catch patterns

## 4. Documentation Improvements

- Added JSDoc comments to all service classes and methods
- Clarified parameter types and return values
- Added deprecation notices for old methods/files

## 5. Performance Improvements

- Reduced excessive timeouts (e.g., WordPress report timeout reduced from 1000s to 300s)
- Added timeout cap to shutdown process

## 6. Code Duplication Reduction

- Consolidated duplicate PDF service implementations
- Renamed root `processor.js` to `deprecated_processor.js` 
- Created a thin compatibility layer in `src/processor.js` that delegates to `worker.js`

## 7. Removed Unused Code

- Cleaned up unused imports
- Centralized configuration

## 8. Architecture Improvements

- All services now follow a consistent initialization pattern
- Added proper validation of input parameters
- Improved service method signatures for consistency

## Note on Backward Compatibility

These changes have been made with backward compatibility in mind. Existing code that imports the old file names will continue to work through re-export modules, and methods with renamed signatures include backward compatibility methods.

# Appraisers Task Queue Changes

## 2025-04-25: Removed PubSub Implementation

### Summary

Replaced the Google PubSub implementation with direct service calls between Cloud Run services. This simplifies the architecture, reduces latency, and makes debugging easier.

### Changes Made

1. Removed PubSub dependency from `package.json`
2. Transformed `PubSubWorker` class to `Worker` in `worker.js`:
   - Removed PubSub initialization code
   - Removed subscription management
   - Removed message handling
   - Removed DeadLetterQueue publishing
3. Renamed `queueStepProcessing` to `processFromStep` method
4. Updated `/api/process-step` endpoint in `app.js` to directly call the worker
5. Added support for the new `STEP_BUILD_REPORT` step
6. Updated documentation and architecture diagrams in README.md

### Rationale

1. PubSub added unnecessary complexity for simple service-to-service communication
2. Direct calls are more appropriate for immediate processing scenarios
3. Error handling is simplified without the need for a DeadLetterQueue
4. Debugging is easier with direct request/response cycles
5. Processing remains asynchronous from the user's perspective

### Migration Notes

There are no special migration steps needed for this change. The API interface remains the same, but processing now happens synchronously from the backend's perspective (though still asynchronously from the user's perspective).

### Next Steps

1. Monitor performance to ensure the direct approach remains scalable
2. Consider implementing a simple retry mechanism for failed steps
3. Enhance error reporting in the API responses
