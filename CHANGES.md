# Code Refactoring Changes

This document outlines the changes made to improve code quality in the Appraisers Task Queue module.

## 1. Service File Standardization

All service files have been standardized to follow the `.service.js` naming convention:

- `email.js` → `email.service.js`
- `wordpress.js` → `wordpress.service.js` 
- `openai.js` → `openai.service.js`

For backward compatibility, the original files have been maintained as re-export modules that import from the new standardized files.

## 2. Method Naming Standardization

Methods names have been standardized across services for consistency:

- In `wordpress.service.js`: `getPost()` → `getAppraisalPost()` (with backward compatibility)
- Added `isInitialized()` checks to all services 

## 3. Improved Error Handling

- Added better error handling in service methods
- Enhanced logging with more detailed error information
- Fixed inconsistent try/catch patterns

## 4. Documentation Improvements

- Added JSDoc comments to all service classes and methods
- Clarified parameter types and return values
- Added deprecation notices for old methods/files

## 5. Performance Improvements

- Reduced excessive timeouts (e.g., WordPress report timeout reduced from 1000s to 300s)
- Added timeout cap to shutdown process

## 6. Code Duplication Reduction

- Consolidated duplicate PDF service implementations
- Renamed root `processor.js` to `deprecated_processor.js` 
- Created a thin compatibility layer in `src/processor.js` that delegates to `worker.js`

## 7. Removed Unused Code

- Cleaned up unused imports
- Centralized configuration

## 8. Architecture Improvements

- All services now follow a consistent initialization pattern
- Added proper validation of input parameters
- Improved service method signatures for consistency

## Note on Backward Compatibility

These changes have been made with backward compatibility in mind. Existing code that imports the old file names will continue to work through re-export modules, and methods with renamed signatures include backward compatibility methods.

# Appraisers Task Queue Changes

## 2025-04-25: Removed PubSub Implementation

### Summary

Replaced the Google PubSub implementation with direct service calls between Cloud Run services. This simplifies the architecture, reduces latency, and makes debugging easier.

### Changes Made

1. Removed PubSub dependency from `package.json`
2. Transformed `PubSubWorker` class to `Worker` in `worker.js`:
   - Removed PubSub initialization code
   - Removed subscription management
   - Removed message handling
   - Removed DeadLetterQueue publishing
3. Renamed `queueStepProcessing` to `processFromStep` method
4. Updated `/api/process-step` endpoint in `app.js` to directly call the worker
5. Added support for the new `STEP_BUILD_REPORT` step
6. Updated documentation and architecture diagrams in README.md

### Rationale

1. PubSub added unnecessary complexity for simple service-to-service communication
2. Direct calls are more appropriate for immediate processing scenarios
3. Error handling is simplified without the need for a DeadLetterQueue
4. Debugging is easier with direct request/response cycles
5. Processing remains asynchronous from the user's perspective

### Migration Notes

There are no special migration steps needed for this change. The API interface remains the same, but processing now happens synchronously from the backend's perspective (though still asynchronously from the user's perspective).

### Next Steps

1. Monitor performance to ensure the direct approach remains scalable
2. Consider implementing a simple retry mechanism for failed steps
3. Enhance error reporting in the API responses

## 2025-04-25: Added GPT-4o Image Analysis Endpoint

### Summary

Added a specialized endpoint for analyzing images with GPT-4o and merging descriptions, providing a standalone step for image analysis and description merging.

### Changes Made

1. Added new `/api/analyze-image-and-merge` endpoint in `app.js`
2. Implemented `analyzeImageAndMergeDescriptions` method in the Worker class
3. Added `analyzeImageWithGPT4o` method to the OpenAI service
4. Modernized the OpenAI service to use the newer SDK
5. Updated the mergeDescriptions method to use GPT-4-turbo with JSON output

### Key Features

1. **Image Analysis**: Fetches the main image from WordPress and analyzes it with GPT-4o
2. **Expert Description**: Uses an art/antiquity expert prompt to generate detailed image descriptions
3. **Description Merging**: Combines the AI image analysis with customer descriptions
4. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts structured metadata about the artwork
5. **Spreadsheet Integration**: Stores results in the appropriate Google Sheets columns

### Usage

```javascript
// Example API call
const response = await fetch('https://appraisers-task-queue-856401495068.us-central1.run.app/api/analyze-image-and-merge', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: "140", // Appraisal ID in spreadsheet
    postId: "145911", // WordPress post ID
    description: "Optional customer description" // Customer description (optional)
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
```

### Tech Stack Changes

1. Updated OpenAI integration to use the official SDK
2. Added node-fetch for image downloading
3. Implemented base64 encoding for image processing
4. Structured JSON responses for better integration
5. Cross-sheet appraisal lookup capabilities

## 2025-04-26: Added AppraisalFinder Utility

### Summary

Added a specialized utility for finding appraisals across both Pending and Completed sheets, eliminating duplicate code and fixing issues with processing completed appraisals.

### Changes Made

1. Created `AppraisalFinder` utility class in `utils/appraisal-finder.js`
2. Updated `Worker` and `AppraisalService` to use the new utility
3. Fixed the `STEP_SET_VALUE` processing to look in both sheets
4. Refactored service methods to use consistent sheet searching pattern
5. Improved error handling for when appraisals cannot be found

### Key Features

1. **Cross-Sheet Search**: Automatically searches for appraisal data in both pending and completed sheets
2. **Unified Interface**: Provides a consistent interface for finding appraisal data
3. **Improved Error Reporting**: Better error messages when appraisals cannot be found
4. **Code Reusability**: Eliminates duplicate code for sheet searching logic

### Benefits

1. Completed appraisals can now be reprocessed without errors
2. Reduced code duplication across the codebase
3. Consistent approach to finding appraisal data
4. Centralized error handling for sheet searching operations
