# Code Refactoring Changes

This document outlines the changes made to improve code quality in the Appraisers Task Queue module.

## 1. Service File Standardization

All service files have been standardized to follow the `.service.js` naming convention:

- `email.js` → `email.service.js`
- `wordpress.js` → `wordpress.service.js` 
- `openai.js` → `openai.service.js`

For backward compatibility, the original files have been maintained as re-export modules that import from the new standardized files.

## 2. Method Naming Standardization

Methods names have been standardized across services for consistency:

- In `wordpress.service.js`: `getPost()` → `getAppraisalPost()` (with backward compatibility)
- Added `isInitialized()` checks to all services 

## 3. Improved Error Handling

- Added better error handling in service methods
- Enhanced logging with more detailed error information
- Fixed inconsistent try/catch patterns

## 4. Documentation Improvements

- Added JSDoc comments to all service classes and methods
- Clarified parameter types and return values
- Added deprecation notices for old methods/files

## 5. Performance Improvements

- Reduced excessive timeouts (e.g., WordPress report timeout reduced from 1000s to 300s)
- Added timeout cap to shutdown process

## 6. Code Duplication Reduction

- Consolidated duplicate PDF service implementations
- Renamed root `processor.js` to `deprecated_processor.js` 
- Created a thin compatibility layer in `src/processor.js` that delegates to `worker.js`

## 7. Removed Unused Code

- Cleaned up unused imports
- Centralized configuration

## 8. Architecture Improvements

- All services now follow a consistent initialization pattern
- Added proper validation of input parameters
- Improved service method signatures for consistency

## Note on Backward Compatibility

These changes have been made with backward compatibility in mind. Existing code that imports the old file names will continue to work through re-export modules, and methods with renamed signatures include backward compatibility methods.
