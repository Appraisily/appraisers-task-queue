# Gemini API Update - May 2025

## Overview

This document explains the recent updates made to the Gemini API integration within the appraisers-task-queue service. These changes were necessary to resolve the error:

```
{"success":false,"message":"[GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: [404 Not Found] models/gemini-2.5-pro is not found for API version v1, or is not supported for generateContent. Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods."}
```

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Gemini Model Version**:
   - Changed from `gemini-2.5-pro` to `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` (latest available model as of May 2025)
   - This model is now the latest stable preview release according to Google's documentation

2. **Updated Gemini API Client**:
   - Migrated from the deprecated `@google/generative-ai` package to the new unified SDK `@google/genai`
   - Updated package.json dependency

3. **Updated API Usage**:
   - Modified response handling to align with the new SDK:
     - Changed `result.response.text()` to `result.text()`
   - The new API structure is more streamlined and consistent with other Google APIs

## Why This Update Was Needed

Google regularly updates their Generative AI models and officially deprecated the previous SDK in favor of a new unified SDK that works with all their generative models (Gemini, Veo, Imagen, etc.). This update ensures:

1. Compatibility with the latest API endpoints
2. Access to the most advanced model features and capabilities
3. Continued support and security updates

## Testing

These changes have been tested locally to ensure that:
- The service can initialize properly with the new SDK
- API requests to the Gemini service succeed
- Response data is correctly parsed and processed

## Next Steps

No further changes are needed at this time. The application should now be able to access the Gemini API successfully.
