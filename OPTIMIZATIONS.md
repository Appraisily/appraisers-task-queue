# Appraisers Task Queue Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations made to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance in the appraisers-task-queue service.

## Core Problems Identified

1. **Redundant API Calls**: The code was repeatedly checking which sheet (Pending or Completed) an appraisal was in for each operation, resulting in multiple unnecessary API calls.
2. **Value Formatting Issues**: When setting appraisal values, the code was incorrectly handling Promise objects, resulting in empty objects (`{}`) being saved to the sheet.
3. **Inefficient Data Retrieval**: Instead of batching related data fetches, the code was making individual API calls for each field, significantly increasing latency.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. AppraisalFinder Cache

Added a caching mechanism to the `AppraisalFinder` class to remember which sheet (Pending or Completed) an appraisal is in, eliminating redundant checks.

```javascript
constructor(sheetsService) {
  this.logger = createLogger('AppraisalFinder');
  this.sheetsService = sheetsService;
  this.appraisalLocationCache = new Map(); // Cache to remember which sheet an appraisal is in
}
```

### 2. Batch Data Retrieval

Added a new `getMultipleFields` method to `AppraisalFinder` to retrieve multiple data points in a single API call:

```javascript
async getMultipleFields(id, columns) {
  // First determine which sheet to use
  const { exists, usingCompletedSheet } = await this.appraisalExists(id);
  
  if (!exists) {
    throw new Error(`Appraisal ${id} not found in either sheet`);
  }
  
  // Create a full range that includes all requested columns
  const fullRange = `A${id}:Z${id}`;
  const { data } = await this.findAppraisalData(id, fullRange);
  
  // Process and return the requested columns as a simple object
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Improved Value Handling

Enhanced the `updateValues` method in `SheetsService` to properly handle various types of values:

- Added special handling for Promise objects to prevent `[object Promise]` strings from being stringified incorrectly
- Improved error handling when stringifying complex objects
- Better type conversion for various data types
- More detailed logging of value transformations

### 4. Optimized Process Flow

Updated the worker.js file to use the optimized methods:

- Modified `STEP_SET_VALUE` to fetch all needed data in a single call
- Modified `STEP_MERGE_DESCRIPTIONS` to also use the batch retrieval method
- Ensured proper value formatting before updating WordPress

## Results

These changes should significantly reduce the number of API calls to Google Sheets, leading to:

1. Faster processing of appraisals
2. Reduced likelihood of hitting API rate limits
3. Proper handling of all value types, eliminating the `{}` formatting issue
4. More detailed logging to help identify any future issues

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing a more robust caching strategy that could persist across service restarts
2. Further reduce API calls by prefetching commonly accessed data
3. Add more comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for transient API failures
